Unit 2 Let’s Recycle!
M: Hi, Jane! Have you heard about the new laws to
help people recycle?
W: I heard about them on the news last night. I
don’t think I like them.
M: The government wants to keep the environment
clean by recycling paper, metal, and glass
instead of throwing these things away.
W: But who wants to pay an extra 50 cents each
time you buy a cup of coffee? That’s a lot of
money!
M: 50 cents? It’s only five cents extra for a paper
cup.
W: I thought it was 50 cents!
M: No, it’s only five cents. Don’t worry. And you
can get your money back when you return the
cup.
W: That’s fair. Well, maybe the government is right,
after all. I’ll return all the paper coffee cups I use
from now on.
M: Good! We all need to recycle. It helps to keep
the environment clean.
