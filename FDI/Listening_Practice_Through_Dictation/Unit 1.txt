Unit 1 A Picnic by the River
W: This is a good spot. Let’s stop and have our picnic
next to the river.
M: Good idea. Walking always makes me hungry.
I’m ready for lunch.
W: We can sit here on the grass. Oh no! Someone
forgot to throw these empty paper bags away.
There is litter everywhere!
M: Why do people always leave litter around? It’s
not a nice thing to do. It spoils other people’s
picnics.
W: I think they are lazy. Or maybe they just don’t
care. Look, there are some empty cans and glass
bottles under that tree, too.
M: People should clean up before they leave, and
not leave litter lying around.
W: That’s right. Well, after our picnic, let’s pick up
all the litter we can and take it out of here.
M: OK! And next week, let’s come back with
friends and pick up some more.
W: Good idea!
